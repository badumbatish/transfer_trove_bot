In the vibrant realm of university life, 'Cal Simps' like Natasha and myself, Jasmine, stand out with our theatrical devotion to UC Berkeley. Natasha’s dorm is a shrine—walls draped in blue and gold, mornings heralded by the Cal fight song. Jasmine, donning Berkeley-themed outfits daily, parades around campus, leading cheers with a megaphone, and organizes weekly tributes at the founders' statue.

Our extreme Berkeley love, though perplexing to some, highlights the transformative impact of the university. We don't just attend Berkeley; we embody it in every act and adornment, turning our education into a grand, ongoing celebration. Through our eyes, Berkeley isn’t merely an institution but a passion—a spectacle where every day is a festival of loyalty and pride.
